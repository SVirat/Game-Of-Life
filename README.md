# Game Of Life
This is a Java project to simulate Conway's Game of Life. Information about this can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
The worlds currently used are Glider, Beacon, Boat, R-Pentomino, and a randomly generated world. However, more can be added with minimal change to the main method.
